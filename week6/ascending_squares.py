"""A program that takes a number n given by the user, and prints out the first n squares."""

# Given below is the complete solution,
# but the lines have all been switched around.
# Can you rearrange the order of the lines,
# so that the program works as intended?

# Hint, in VSCode, you can hold down the alt-key while pressing the up/down arrows
# to move the lines around.
# Similar keyboard shortcuts should probably be found in most editors.
